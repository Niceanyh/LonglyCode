### Lecture 1  Theory of computation  
#### The law of computation :
&#8195;• Automata Theory studies the law of computation which tell us what is possible and impossible for computers;  
&#8195;• Machine learning algorithms; Applying machine learning algorithms to practical problems;

#### Formal language and Automata Theory :
&#8195;• Automata describe the operation of a device/process; used in lexical analyze to recognize expression in programming language.  
&#8195;•
