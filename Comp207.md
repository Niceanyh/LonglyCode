#### Relational database :
&#8195;• Data is organised in tables(also called relations)  
&#8195;• All element in an attribute are of the same datatype  
&#8195;• Each table has a schema. The schema of Items is Items(name,price,number)  
&#8195;• Columns/attributes are fixed, rows depends on the table can change  
&#8195;• For OO Programmingm, if two rows are the same, we view them as being the same item

&#8195;• Relational database are accessed using SQL(Standard Query Language)    
&#8195;• Data Definition Language(DDL):Create/alter/delete databases,tables and their attributes.  
&#8195;• Data Manipulation Language(DML):Add/remove/update and query rows in tables.  
&#8195;• Transact-SQL
