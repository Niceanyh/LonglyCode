&#8195;• All element in an attribute are of the same datatype  
&#8195;• Each table has a schema. The schema of Items is Items(name,price,number)  

#### Formal language and Automata Theory :
&#8195;• Automata describe the operation of a device/process; used in lexical analyze to recognize expression in programming language.  
&#8195;• 

#### Different kind of machine:
&#8195;• finite machine  
&#8195;• pushdown machine 
&#8195;• Turing machine 
&#8195;• resource-bounded Turing machine  

### Lecture 2  Language
