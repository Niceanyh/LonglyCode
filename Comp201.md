#### software engineering task:  
&#8195;define requirement  
&#8195;design the product  
&#8195;implement and test  
&#8195;managing the process  

#### what is software engineering ?  
&#8195;Software engineering is an engineering discipline which is concerned with all aspects of software production.  
  
#### what is software process ?  
&#8195;software process is a set of activities whose goal is the development or evolution of software.  

#### Fundamental four activities in all software processes are:  
&#8195;Specification - what the system should do and its development constraints  
&#8195;Development - production of the software system (design and implementation)  
  Validation - checking that the software is what the customer wants  
  Evolution - changing the software in response to changing demands  

#### Four Attributes of Good Softwareï¼š  
  Maintainability - Software must (easily) evolvable to meet changing needs   
  Efficiency - Software should not make wasteful use of system resources  
  Dependability - Software must be trustworthy (work with all data) 
  Usability - Software must be usable by the users for which it was designed  

#### Issues of Professional Responsibility  
confidentiality  
competence  
intellectual property rights  
computer misuse
