### Lecture 1  Introduction  
#### software engineering task:
&#8195;define requirement  
&#8195;design the product  
&#8195;implement and test  
&#8195;managing the process  

#### what is software engineering ?
&#8195;Software engineering is an engineering discipline which is concerned with all aspects of software production.  
  
#### what is software process ?
&#8195;software process is a set of activities whose goal is the development or evolution of software.  

#### Fundamental four activities in all software processes are:
&#8195;Specification - what the system should do and its development constraints  
&#8195;Development - production of the software system (design and implementation)  
&#8195;Validation - checking that the software is what the customer wants  
&#8195;Evolution - changing the software in response to changing demands  

#### Four Attributes of Good Software: 
&#8195;Maintainability - Software must (easily) evolvable to meet changing needs   
&#8195;Efficiency - Software should not make wasteful use of system resources  
&#8195;Dependability - Software must be trustworthy (work with all data) 
&#8195;Usability - Software must be usable by the users for which it was designed  

#### Issues of Professional Responsibility
&#8195;confidentiality  
&#8195;competence  
&#8195;intellectual property rights  
&#8195;computer misuse  

### Lecture 2  Software Process  
#### Process life cycle
&#8195;Specifying, Designing, Implementing and Testing.

#### The Waterfall Model 
&#8195;

#### Evolutionary Development
