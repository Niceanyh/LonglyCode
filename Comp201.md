### Lecture 1  Introduction  
#### software engineering task:
&#8195;define requirement  
&#8195;design the product  
&#8195;implement and test  
&#8195;managing the process  

#### what is software engineering ?
&#8195;Software engineering is an engineering discipline which is concerned with all aspects of software production.  
  
#### what is software process ?
&#8195;software process is a set of activities whose goal is the development or evolution of software.  

#### Fundamental four activities in all software processes are:
&#8195;Specification - what the system should do and its development constraints  
&#8195;Development - production of the software system (design and implementation)  
&#8195;Validation - checking that the software is what the customer wants  
&#8195;Evolution - changing the software in response to changing demands  

#### Four Attributes of Good Software: 
&#8195;Maintainability - Software must (easily) evolvable to meet changing needs   
&#8195;Efficiency - Software should not make wasteful use of system resources  
&#8195;Dependability - Software must be trustworthy (work with all data)  
&#8195;Usability - Software must be usable by the users for which it was designed  

#### Issues of Professional Responsibility
&#8195;confidentiality  
&#8195;competence  
&#8195;intellectual property rights  
&#8195;computer misuse  

### Lecture 2  Software Process  
#### Process life cycle
&#8195;Specifying, Designing, Implementing and Testing.

#### The Waterfall Model  
&#8195;Inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages, it is difficult to respond to changing customer requirements. Waterfall model describes a process of stepwise refinement.  

#### Evolutionary Development  
![Evolutionary Development](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/15/0ohgF1.md.png)  
&#8195;evolutionary development is based upon the idea of developing an initial implementation, exposing it to the user and refining it based upon their response.  
&#8195;problemï¼šLack of process visibility and rare in safety critical, systems are sometimes poorly structured.  

#### Agile Development  

#### Incremental Development(Scrum)
&#8195;the development and delivery is broken down into increments (SCRUM sprints) with each increment delivering part of the required functionality  
&#8195;User requirements are prioritised  
&#8195;Once the development of an increment is started, the requirements are frozen  
&#8195;Advantage: customer requirement, Lower risk of overall project failure.
