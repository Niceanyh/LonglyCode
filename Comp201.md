### Lecture 1  Introduction  
#### Software engineering task:
&#8195;define requirement  
&#8195;design the product  
&#8195;implement and test  
&#8195;managing the process  

#### What is software engineering ?
&#8195;Software engineering is an engineering discipline which is concerned with all aspects of software production.  
  
#### What is software process ?
&#8195;software process is a set of activities whose goal is the development or evolution of software.  

#### Fundamental four activities in all software processes are:
&#8195;Specification - what the system should do and its development constraints  
&#8195;Development - production of the software system (design and implementation)  
&#8195;Validation - checking that the software is what the customer wants  
&#8195;Evolution - changing the software in response to changing demands  

#### Four Attributes of Good Software: 
&#8195;Maintainability - Software must (easily) evolvable to meet changing needs   
&#8195;Efficiency - Software should not make wasteful use of system resources  
&#8195;Dependability - Software must be trustworthy (work with all data)  
&#8195;Usability - Software must be usable by the users for which it was designed  

#### Issues of Professional Responsibility
&#8195;confidentiality  
&#8195;competence  
&#8195;intellectual property rights  
&#8195;computer misuse  

### Lecture 2  Software Process  
#### Process life cycle
&#8195;Specifying, Designing, Implementing and Testing.

#### The Waterfall Model  
&#8195;Inflexible partitioning of the project into distinct stages, it is difficult to respond to changing customer requirements. Waterfall model describes a process of stepwise refinement.  

#### Evolutionary Development  
![Evolutionary Development](https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/15/0ohgF1.md.png)  
&#8195;evolutionary development is based upon the idea of developing an initial implementation, exposing it to the user and refining it based upon their response.  
&#8195;problem：Lack of process visibility and rare in safety critical, systems are sometimes poorly structured.  

#### Incremental Development(Scrum,one kind of Agile Development)
&#8195;the development and delivery is broken down into increments (SCRUM sprints) with each increment delivering part of the required functionality  
&#8195;User requirements are prioritised  
&#8195;Once the development of an increment is started, the requirements are frozen  
&#8195;Advantage: customer requirement, Lower risk of overall project failure.  

### Lecture 3  Requirements engineering  

#### Software Specification
&#8195;Definition: the process of establishing what services are required and the constraints on the system’s operation and development.  

#### The Requirements Engineering Process
&#8195;Requirements engineering is the process of developing a software specification.

#### Software Design and Implementation(inter-leaved)
&#8195;Definition: The process of converting the system specification into an executable system    
##### Software design:
Design a software structure that realises the specification,and design database, website design, data structures, communications protocols.  
&#8195;*Architectural design（major sub-system）  
&#8195;*Abstract specification  
&#8195;*Interface design  
&#8195;*Component design  
&#8195;*Data structure design  
&#8195;*Algorithm design  

##### Implementation:
&#8195;Translate this structure into an executable program.  

##### Programming and Debugging
&#8195;Programming and Debugging consist of translating a design into a program and removing errors from that program.  

#### Software testing process 
Good programming is iterative.

### Lecture 4  Software Requirement
#### Requirement engineering 
&#8195;Requirement engineering is the process of generating the description of the system services and constraints. The services is customer Requirement from a system, the constraint is a program operates and developed.  
#### Why do we need Requirement 
&#8195;To ensure that a Software correctly solves a particular problem.  
&#8195;poorly defined Requirement can cause major problems to a project in both financial terms as well as added time.  

#### What is Requirement 
&#8195;Range from a high-level abstract statement of a service or of a system constraint to a detailed mathematical functional specification.  
&#8195;Requirement May be the basis for a bid for a contract.(Requirement must be defined in detail and open to interpretation)  

#### Type of Requirement 
&#8195;User Requirement(for customer)  
&#8195;System Requirement(as a contract)  
&#8195;Software Specification(for developer)   
&#8195;  
&#8195;Functional requirement  
&#8195;Non-functional requirement. (System properties and constraint,process requirement)    
&#8195;Domain requirement  

#### Precision Requirements 
&#8195;Problem arise when requirements are not precisely stated.  
&#8195;Ambiguous requirements may be interpreted in different way between user and developer.  
&#8195;So,in principle requirement should be both Complete and Consistent.
