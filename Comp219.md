### Lecture 1  Introduction  
#### Learning outcome:
&#8195;• Basic algorithms that have been used to enable the AI agents to conduct the perception, inference, and planning tasks; Applying basic AI algorithms to solve problems;  
&#8195;• Machine learning algorithms; Applying machine learning algorithms to practical problems;  

### Lecture 2  Machine Learning overview  
#### What is Machine Learning  
&#8195;Programs that can improve their performance by applying learning algorithm on training data  

#### Applications of machine learning
&#8195;(machine learning used When program can't do with reasonable efforts/can't define rules by hand)  
&#8195;hand-written digit recognition(One of the first commercial and widely used ML systems)  
&#8195;Face detection(Classifier is learnt from labelled data)  
&#8195;Spam detection(classification problem)  
&#8195;Stock price prediction(regression task)  

#### Represent instances as fixed-length feature vectors
&#8195;Representing instances using feature vectors(use a fixed-length vector to represent features of each instance)  
&#8195;Another view of the feature-vector representation: a single database table  

### Lecture 3  Learning Basics
#### Data collection
&#8195;we often assume that training instances are independent and identically distributed   
#### Three canonical learning problems
&#8195;Regression -supervised  
&#8195;Classification -supervised  
&#8195;Unsupervised Learning  -Clustering -dimensionality reduction
